It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.

The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D.; Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations.

Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and ""other"" food product industries.

The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than ""married"" or ""living common-law"" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over. Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation. In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article. ",Canadian farm families more dependant on off-farm income,/n1/en/catalogue/21-004-x20030036478

Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. Promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution. However, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life in association with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario.

This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.

This provides a challenge to national, provincial and local decision-makers to find new goods and services to export in order to help stabilise the employment levels in communities that are dependent upon primary sector employment. The purpose of this bulletin is to investigate the changing structure of primary sector employment in rural Canada in the 1980s and the 1990s. Specifically, we look at employment in the agricultural industry and employment in all other primary industries (i.e. fishing, logging and forestry, mining and oil and natural gas extraction, and hunting and trapping).

Analysis,Agriculture,Agri-food industries; Agricultural products; Farmers; Farms; Food processing; Food services; Horticulture; Jobs,2003-12-11,"While the number of census-farms and farm operators is shrinking, the number of jobs in the agriculture and agri-food industry is growing. During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms. Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing.

The FEMS results presented here provide an overview of grazing practices. However, management practices that could be protective or detrimental to the environment and that relate to grazing systems are much broader than those included in this bulletin. Further, regional differences in climate and soil quality mean that there is no ""optimal"" or ""correct"" grazing practice that is applicable throughout the whole country or even within an individual province.

It explores the role that certain factors play in conditioning the likelihood of survival - factors related to industry structure, firm demographics and macroeconomic cycles. It asks whether the determinants of failure are different for new start-ups than for firms that have reached adolescence, and if the magnitude of these differences is economically significant. It examines whether, after controlling for certain influences, failure rates differ across industries and provinces. Two themes figure prominently in this analysis. The first is the impact that certain industry characteristics - such as average firm size and concentration - have on the entry/exit process, either through their influence on failure costs or on the intensity of competition. The second centres on how the dimensions of failure evolve over time as new firms gain market experience.

The Statistical report is meant to be a tool for learning as well as planning. The data identify populations at risk; suggest associations between health determinants, health status, and population characteristics; raise questions about the reasons for the widespread differences among the provinces and territories; and illustrate areas where Canada's health information system is robust, and others where it is relatively weak.

It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology. Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology.

Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products. Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.

In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews.

Reference,Health,Food; Health surveys; Nutrition; Survey design; Survey methodology,2008-03-17,"National Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders .

Reference,Health,Weighting and estimation,1994-06-15,A regression weight generation procedure is applied to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Regression estimation was used because of the large nonresponse in the survey. The regression weights are generalized least squares weights modified so that all weights are positive and so that large weights are smaller than the least squares weights. It is demonstrated that the regression estimator has the potential for large reductions in mean square error relative to the simple direct estimator in the presence of nonresponse. ,Regression weighting in the presence of nonresponse with application to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey,/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-x199400114429

A unique feature of NHANES is the administration of a complete medical examination for each respondent in the sample. To standardize administration, these examinations are carried out in mobile examination centers. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors. The sample design for NHANES must create a balance between the requirements for efficient annual and multiyear samples and the flexibility that allows changes in key design parameters to make the survey more responsive to the needs of the research and health policy communities. This paper discusses the challenges involved in designing and implementing a sample selection process that satisfies the goals of NHANES.

The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers. Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada. In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level. The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population.
