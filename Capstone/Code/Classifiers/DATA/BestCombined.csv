Studying scenarios of nutrition intervention: the example of soft drinks,"Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, it is possible to estimate the distributions of usual nutrient intake. It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.

Fork in the road: Canadian agriculture and food on the move,"Food is as much a necessity as the air we breathe and the water we drink. But do we know where our food comes from, and what it takes to get it into our kitchens? The question of where our food is grown or processed is coming under increased scrutiny, not just in Canada but in other countries, including our trading partners. Concerns underlying this increased focus include discussions of energy consumption required for food transport, environmental concerns, product safety, food security and food costs.

Methodological challenges in analyzing nutrition data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition,"Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition in 2004. The survey's main objective was to estimate the distributions of Canadians' usual dietary intake at the provincial level for 15 age-sex groups. Such distributions are generally estimated with the SIDE application, but with the choices that were made concerning sample design and method of estimating sampling variability, obtaining those estimates is not a simple matter. This article describes the methodological challenges in estimating usual intake distributions from the survey data using SIDE.

Impact of telephone versus face to face repeat 24-hour recall interviews on food and nutrition surveys,"Many population surveys collecting food consumption data use 24 hour recall methodology to capture detailed one day intakes. In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews.

Consumer tastes can shift over time, as new commodities are introduced and others become outdated. Changes in the demographic, economic and social characteristics of consumers can also affect consumer preferences, as can shifts in the relative prices, utilities and quality levels of various goods and services. Based on Family Expenditure Survey data for both 1986 and 1996, this study examines how the household consumption of services has shifted over the past decade. Particular attention is paid to spending on: communications services; finance and real estate services; food and beverage services; traveler accommodation services; amusement and recreation services; and personal and household services. Insights are also provided on why household spending patterns for specific service commodities have changed from 1986 to 1996.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/63f0002x/63f0002x1999021-eng.pdf,Consumption

To contribute to the broader goal of minimizing survey nonresponse, this study considers several factors that can impact survey nonresponse, using a 2007 Animal Welfare Survey Conducted in Ohio, USA. In particular, the paper examines the extent to which topic salience and incentives affect survey participation and item nonresponse, drawing on the leverage-saliency theory (Groves, Singer and Corning 2000). We find that participation in a survey is affected by its subject context (as this exerts either positive or negative leverage on sampled units) and prepaid incentives, which is consistent with the leverage-saliency theory. Our expectations are also confirmed by the finding that item nonresponse, our proxy for response quality, does vary by proximity to agriculture and the environment (residential location, knowledge about how food is grown, and views about the importance of animal welfare). However, the data suggests that item nonresponse does not vary according to whether or not a respondent received incentives.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2010001/article/11252-eng.pdf,Consumption

It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-522-x/2006001/article/10396-eng.pdf,Consumption

The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined.The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D. Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m1999101-eng.pdf,Utilization

Major group industry data are shown with and without adjustment for seasonal variation. Unadjusted shipment totals by province and by major groups within provinces are also shown. These data are used to monitor the business cycle in the manufacturing sector of the economy, to evaluate and develop financial and industrial policy, and to provide market data at the detailed industry level. Related information on manufacturers' opinions on the current state of inventories and orders and about employment and production prospects over the next three months are available from the Business Conditions Survey (BCS). The survey is carried out at the beginning of January, April, July and October. Responses are available approximately five days after the reference month in Statistics Canada's The Daily.

The expansion of large livestock farms between 1991 and 2001,"Over the last few years, the rapid expansion of large livestock operations has fuelled heated debates in many rural communities across Canada. Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. Promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution. However, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life in association with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario. Still others are upset by prospects of added truck traffic, dust and noise resulting from feed and livestock transportation. ",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/21-004-x20030096514,Supply

Changes in Crop Prices before and after Releases of Statistics Canada's Field Crop Reporting Series Publications,"Statistics Canada administers six surveys per year to collect information on intended, seeded and harvested acreages, yields, production and stocks of principal field crops, and publishes these survey estimates in the Field Crop Reporting Series (FCRS). This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.

"A Tale of Three Cities: The Dynamics of Manufacturing in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, 1976-1997 Archived"," Recent research has suggested that investment has shifted from urban areas to more rural locales. However, Canadian manufacturing remains predominantly an urban activity with more than...Description: Recent research has suggested that investment has shifted from urban areas to more rural locales. However, Canadian manufacturing remains predominantly an urban activity with more than 40% of manufacturing employment located in Canada's three largest urban regions. This paper examines the changing manufacturing landscapes of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and outlines the shifts in industry mix, employment, and wage levels that have taken place over the period between 1976 and 1997. The analysis uses a longitudinal plant-level database based upon the Annual Survey of Manufactures conducted by Statistics Canada.Toronto and Vancouver both experience growth in the manufacturing sector, while Montreal experiences decline driven by differences in their industrial structure. Manufacturing activity has increased in a number of sectors of Toronto's economy, but has been particularly influenced by the growing automotive sector that ties the city to a large North American market. Montreal has experienced declines across most of the manufacturing industries. A heavy concentration of employment in labour intensive industries such as textiles and clothing, which have experienced severe declines across Canada, has amplified the level of decline in Montreal. However, Montreal has seen some growth in science-based industries. While Vancouver's manufacturing economy is much smaller in absolute terms, maintaining slightly less than a 5% share of national manufacturing employment, it has exhibited higher levels of long-run growth and restructuring than its eastern counterparts. A second focus of the paper is to explore the relationship between economic volatility and diversity in the manufacturing sector using a number of statistical measures. Toronto and Montreal have diverse industrial structures, although each has become slightly more concentrated over the study period. In Montreal, this is due to the increasing importance of other industries, as the clothing and textiles industry declines. In Toronto, this can be attributed to the increased importance of the food and transportation equipment industries. Vancouver has become increasingly diversified over the study period, reflecting the growth and dynamism of this sector. The mature manufacturing economies of Toronto and Montreal exhibit lower levels of volatility than their western counterpart.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2001177-eng.pdf,Supply

Technological advances include computer-based information and control systems, as well as sophisticated processing and packaging methods that enhance product quality, improve food safety and reduce costs. Continuous quality improvement and benchmarking are examples of related business practices. This study examines the use of advanced technologies in the food-processing industry. It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology.Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology. Firms that differ in size and nationality choose to pursue different technological strategies. This study focuses on how these differences are reflected in the different use of technology for large and small establishments, for foreign and domestic plants and for plants in different industries.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/88-518-X,Supply

The compendium has been designed as a profile of the information society, focusing on current trends, as well as an historical overview of the growth and development of the Canadian ICT sector industries. The publication contains two main parts. The first provides a statistical overview of the ICT sector on the basis of key economic variables, including production, employment, international trade, revenue and R&D expenditure. A summary of international ICT sector comparisons for selected variables, using recent data published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is also included here. The ever widening use of, and access to ICTs in the home, at work, in schools and by governments is examined in the second part. Many different data sources have been used throughout the project, and while all efforts have been made to maximize the amount of data available, it has not been possible in all instances to consistently report for all ICT industries and all relevant variables. The conversion to the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) has largely contributed to these difficulties, and it is expected that a greater range of data will be available once all of the survey programs begin reporting on the basis of this new industry classification.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/56-504-X,Supply

The results are...Description: This paper estimates price-marginal cost mark-ups for Canadian manufacturing industries in order to assess the impact of import competition on domestic market power. The results are mixed. Although the overall relationship between mark-ups and imports is positive across industries for the early 1970s and insignificant for the late 1970s, there is some weak cross-sectional evidence to suggest that imports reduce market power in domestically concentrated industries. Changes in imports between the two periods, however, have a positive impact on mark-ups in concentrated industries. Thus, there is no consistent evidence for Canada that imports have had the beneficial impact on competition that has been emphasized in much of the literature. In contrast, an interesting result of the paper is that increases in exports are associated with reductions in mark-ups, suggesting that exports may have a stronger pro-competitive impact on domestic firms than imports.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2000139-eng.pdf,Supply

Nevertheless, organic farming still occupies only a small niche in Canada's agricultural sector.Located mainly in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the organic fruit and vegetable industry is not showing any particular signs of increased producer participation. Still, supermarkets across the country are setting aside ever-larger portions of their produce sections for organic produce, and natural food stores are expanding rapidly.

Consumers may believe, as a result, that producers of organic food must be receiving more for their product than do their non-organic farming counterparts.Thus, the question begs to be asked: Are organic farmers able to charge more for their produce than non-organic producers? In other words, do organic producers receive a price premium?

A higher seasonal variation in employment exists in rural areas compared with urban areas, and is spread throughout virtually all industrial sectors. The lower industrial productivity and reduced wages that likely result present a particular challenge for developing and revitalizing rural areas. This bulleting is useful for researchers and decision-makers who need information on employment seasonality in rural Canada to create appropriate economic strategies.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-006-x/21-006-x2001008-eng.pdf,Supply

Service Inflation: Why Is It Higher? Archived," Since 1961, the service component of the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) has generally shown a higher rate of increase than the goods component. Furthermore, when some of the more...Description: Since 1961, the service component of the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) has generally shown a higher rate of increase than the goods component. Furthermore, when some of the more volatile components of the CPI are removed the spread widens. For instance, during the same period core goods inflation (excluding food and energy) increased at an annual rate of 4.3% compared to 6.1% per cent for services (excluding shelter). The literature on service sector inflation suggests five explanations for this phenomenon. Although all these sources of the inflation differential are interesting and important in their own right, this paper will examine two. Some believe that service inflation is a statistical artifact stemming from the inherent difficulties in measuring the output of services and hence their price changes. This issue will be examined first. Indeed the measurement problem appears more serious for services; however it cannot be held completely responsible for the inflationary gap. William Baumol (1967) originally suggested the other cause for higher service inflation whereby unbalanced sectorial growth would be the cause of the divergent inflation rates. This explanation will be the focus of the second part of the paper. In spite of the attractiveness of Baumol's model, empirical evidence rejects the hypothesis.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1997005-eng.pdf,Supply

Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products.Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/96-325-x/2014001/article/11921-eng.htm,Supply

Like the original in 1996, this report provides a comprehensive and detailed statistical overview of the health status of Canadians and the major determinants of that status. The original report was created for the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, which has also commissioned this update. The broad purpose of the report is to help policy-makers and program planners identify priority issues and measure progress in the domain of population health.The Statistical report is meant to be a tool for learning as well as planning. The data identify populations at risk; suggest associations between health determinants, health status, and population characteristics; raise questions about the reasons for the widespread differences among the provinces and territories; and illustrate areas where Canada's health information system is robust, and others where it is relatively weak. These and other themes are touched on in the 11 section introductions of the Statistical Report and developed more fully in the companion publication, Toward a healthy future: second report on the health of Canadians.

Methodological challenges in analyzing nutrition data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition,"Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition in 2004. The survey's main objective was to estimate the distributions of Canadians' usual dietary intake at the provincial level for 15 age-sex groups. Such distributions are generally estimated with the SIDE application, but with the choices that were made concerning sample design and method of estimating sampling variability, obtaining those estimates is not a simple matter. This article describes the methodological challenges in estimating usual intake distributions from the survey data using SIDE.

Balancing sample design goals for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,"The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is one of a series of health-related programs sponsored by the United States National Center for Health Statistics. A unique feature of NHANES is the administration of a complete medical examination for each respondent in the sample. To standardize administration, these examinations are carried out in mobile examination centers. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors. The sample design for NHANES must create a balance between the requirements for efficient annual and multiyear samples and the flexibility that allows changes in key design parameters to make the survey more responsive to the needs of the research and health policy communities. This paper discusses the challenges involved in designing and implementing a sample selection process that satisfies the goals of NHANES.
