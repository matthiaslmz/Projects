Data from Revenue Canada taxation of unincorporated and incorporated farms and other agricultural surveys provide the statistical basis for these bulletins. Eight of these bulletins feature a specific farm type providing analysis on such key variables as revenues and expenses, net operating income and net operating margins. Physical characteristics such as crop areas and livestock inventory numbers as well as some distributional data are presented. The first bulletin of this series provides an overview of all farm types combined. The two remaining bulletins present sources and levels of off-farm income for farm operators and farm families for selected farm types. Depending on the variables, the discussion is presented by province or by revenue class. Comparisons of financial performance are also made for selected variables. Tables and graphs support the analytical texts.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/21-005-X,Economic Overview of Farm Incomes Archived

Data are presented for 21 major groups and selected individual industries at the 3- to 6-digit level of detail, as defined by the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), as well as aggregates for durable, non-durable and total manufacturing. Major group industry data are shown with and without adjustment for seasonal variation. Unadjusted shipment totals by province and by major groups within provinces are also shown. These data are used to monitor the business cycle in the manufacturing sector of the economy, to evaluate and develop financial and industrial policy, and to provide market data at the detailed industry level. Related information on manufacturers' opinions on the current state of inventories and orders and about employment and production prospects over the next three months are available from the Business Conditions Survey (BCS). The survey is carried out at the beginning of January, April, July and October. Responses are available approximately five days after the reference month in Statistics Canada's The Daily. The BCS balance of opinion data often serves as a good guide to the direction of change, at least a month in advance of the corresponding quantitative data.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/31-001-X,Monthly Survey of Manufacturing Archived

The OMDS was fielded in March and April 2009 as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey. The aim was to gauge the ability of families to satisfy basic material needs such as food, clothing, housing, as well as social needs of participation and leisure. The survey included questions about ten items deemed to be necessities, due to lack of resources, as well as questions on income. The list of ten items came from a 2008 study by the Daily Bread Food Bank of Toronto. The survey was designed to produce estimates of the incidence of missing two or more items (out of ten) for Ontario and various geographic subgroups. It was also designed to provide contextual data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Ontario families and individuals.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/75M0012X,"Ontario Material Deprivation Survey (OMDS), 2009 Public Use Microdata File"

Like the original in 1996, this report provides a comprehensive and detailed statistical overview of the health status of Canadians and the major determinants of that status. The original report was created for the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, which has also commissioned this update. The broad purpose of the report is to help policy-makers and program planners identify priority issues and measure progress in the domain of population health.The Statistical report is meant to be a tool for learning as well as planning. The data identify populations at risk; suggest associations between health determinants, health status, and population characteristics; raise questions about the reasons for the widespread differences among the provinces and territories; and illustrate areas where Canada's health information system is robust, and others where it is relatively weak. These and other themes are touched on in the 11 section introductions of the Statistical Report and developed more fully in the companion publication, Toward a healthy future: second report on the health of Canadians.

"Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, it is possible to estimate the distributions of usual nutrient intake. It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.

Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D.; Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.

"This paper examines the factors contributing to the adoption of advanced technologies in the Canadian food-processing sector. The numbers of technologies used by a plant is found to be highly correlated with expected gains in firm performance. The benefits of enhanced food safety and quality, as well as productivity improvements, are closely associated with technology use. Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and ""other"" food product industries.

"Total income of farm families is derived from 1999 personal income tax returns of family members. The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than ""married"" or ""living common-law"" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over. Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation. In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article. ",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/21-004-x20030036478,Canadian farm families more dependant on off-farm income

"Statistics Canada administers six surveys per year to collect information on intended, seeded and harvested acreages, yields, production and stocks of principal field crops, and publishes these survey estimates in the Field Crop Reporting Series (FCRS). This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.

"While the number of census-farms and farm operators is shrinking, the number of jobs in the agriculture and agri-food industry is growing. During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms. Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing.

It explores the role that certain factors play in conditioning the likelihood of survival - factors related to industry structure, firm demographics and macroeconomic cycles. It asks whether the determinants of failure are different for new start-ups than for firms that have reached adolescence, and if the magnitude of these differences is economically significant. It examines whether, after controlling for certain influences, failure rates differ across industries and provinces. Two themes figure prominently in this analysis. The first is the impact that certain industry characteristics - such as average firm size and concentration - have on the entry/exit process, either through their influence on failure costs or on the intensity of competition. The second centres on how the dimensions of failure evolve over time as new firms gain market experience.

"Low income cut-offs (LICOs) are income thresholds, determined by analysing family expenditure data, below which families will devote a larger share of income to the necessities of food, shelter and clothing than the average family would. To reflect differences in the costs of necessities among different community and family sizes, LICOs are defined for five categories of community size and seven of family size. Low income Measures (LIMs), on the other hand, are strictly relative measures of low income, set at 50% of adjusted median family income. These measures are categorized according to the number of adults and children present in families, reflecting the economies of scale inherent in family size and composition.

"Horticulture is a type of agriculture that encompasses a wide range of crop production. Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products. Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.

"Many population surveys collecting food consumption data use 24 hour recall methodology to capture detailed one day intakes. In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews.

"National Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders .

A regression weight generation procedure is applied to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Regression estimation was used because of the large nonresponse in the survey. The regression weights are generalized least squares weights modified so that all weights are positive and so that large weights are smaller than the least squares weights. It is demonstrated that the regression estimator has the potential for large reductions in mean square error relative to the simple direct estimator in the presence of nonresponse. ,https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-x199400114429,Regression weighting in the presence of nonresponse with application to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey
"The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is one of a series of health-related programs sponsored by the United States National Center for Health Statistics.

The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors.

"The reference population for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been represented, since the 1992 updating of the basket of goods and services, by families and unattached individuals living in private urban or rural households. The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers. Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada. In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level. The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population.

Data are collected mainly using weekly diaries of purchases that the respondents must fill in daily during two consecutive weeks.The FES, like all surveys, is subject to error despite all the precautions taken at the various stages of the survey to control them. Although there is no exhaustive measure of a survey's data quality, certain quality measures taken at various stages of the survey can provide the user with relevant information to ensure sound data interpretation. This paper presents, for the 2001 FES, the following quality indicators the coefficients of variation, the non-response rates, the vacancy rates, the slippage rates, the imputation rates as well the impacts of imputation on the estimates.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0026m/62f0026m2005003-eng.pdf,"2001 Food Expenditure Survey, Data Quality Indicators Archived"

However, Canadian manufacturing remains predominantly an urban activity with more than 40% of manufacturing employment located in Canada's three largest urban regions. This paper examines the changing manufacturing landscapes of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and outlines the shifts in industry mix, employment, and wage levels that have taken place over the period between 1976 and 1997. The analysis uses a longitudinal plant-level database based upon the Annual Survey of Manufactures conducted by Statistics Canada.Toronto and Vancouver both experience growth in the manufacturing sector, while Montreal experiences decline driven by differences in their industrial structure. Manufacturing activity has increased in a number of sectors of Toronto's economy, but has been particularly influenced by the growing automotive sector that ties the city to a large North American market. Montreal has experienced declines across most of the manufacturing industries. A heavy concentration of employment in labour intensive industries such as textiles and clothing, which have experienced severe declines across Canada, has amplified the level of decline in Montreal. However, Montreal has seen some growth in science-based industries. While Vancouver's manufacturing economy is much smaller in absolute terms, maintaining slightly less than a 5% share of national manufacturing employment, it has exhibited higher levels of long-run growth and restructuring than its eastern counterparts. A second focus of the paper is to explore the relationship between economic volatility and diversity in the manufacturing sector using a number of statistical measures. Toronto and Montreal have diverse industrial structures, although each has become slightly more concentrated over the study period. In Montreal, this is due to the increasing importance of other industries, as the clothing and textiles industry declines. In Toronto, this can be attributed to the increased importance of the food and transportation equipment industries. Vancouver has become increasingly diversified over the study period, reflecting the growth and dynamism of this sector. The mature manufacturing economies of Toronto and Montreal exhibit lower levels of volatility than their western counterpart.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2001177-eng.pdf,"A Tale of Three Cities: The Dynamics of Manufacturing in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, 1976-1997 Archived"

Technological advances include computer-based information and control systems, as well as sophisticated processing and packaging methods that enhance product quality, improve food safety and reduce costs. Continuous quality improvement and benchmarking are examples of related business practices. This study examines the use of advanced technologies in the food-processing industry. It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology.Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology. Firms that differ in size and nationality choose to pursue different technological strategies. This study focuses on how these differences are reflected in the different use of technology for large and small establishments, for foreign and domestic plants and for plants in different industries.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/88-518-X,Advanced Technology in the Canadian Food Industry Archived

The publication contains two main parts. The first provides a statistical overview of the ICT sector on the basis of key economic variables, including production, employment, international trade, revenue and R&D expenditure. A summary of international ICT sector comparisons for selected variables, using recent data published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is also included here. The ever widening use of, and access to ICTs in the home, at work, in schools and by governments is examined in the second part. Many different data sources have been used throughout the project, and while all efforts have been made to maximize the amount of data available, it has not been possible in all instances to consistently report for all ICT industries and all relevant variables. The conversion to the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) has largely contributed to these difficulties, and it is expected that a greater range of data will be available once all of the survey programs begin reporting on the basis of this new industry classification.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/56-504-X,Beyond the Information Highway Networked Canada (Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) Compendium) Archived

The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than ""married"" or ""living common-law"" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over.Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation.In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-004-x/2003003/article/6478-eng.pdf,Canadian farm families more dependant on off-farm income Archived

The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers.Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada.In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level.The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1998013-eng.pdf,Comparative Study of Analytical Consumer Price Indexes for Different Subgroups of the Reference Population Archived

Indeed, many of them have at some point given themselves the mandate to reduce inflation and achieve price stability. The Bank of Canada undertook this mandate in February 1991.Core inflation should reflect what is basic in price movements and ignore temporary fluctuations that have no long-term impact on prices. The phenomenon of core inflation must be of a lasting nature. The targets were initially set on the basis of the overall consumer price index (CPI). However, the Bank of Canada has stated that for practical reasons, it will focus on the consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components. The question that many are asking is the following: is a measure such as the CPI excluding food and energy a good indicator of core inflation? At the meeting of the 1996 Price Measurement Advisory Committee, a review of the literature on core inflation was presented. The Committee recommended taking a closer look at a weighted median index as a means of estimating core inflation. This study deals with the question of a weighted median index and covers the period of January 1985 to January 1997. The rates of change in the weighted median index calculated from monthly movements are quite often lower than the rates of change in the official index. This behaviour reflects the usual distribution of monthly price movements for the CPI, meaning a large proportion of the monthly movements are close to zero, and the remaining price movements are, in majority, positive. Because of this behaviour of monthly movements, the weighted median index advances much more slowly than the official index. This behaviour is just as evident when inflation advances at annual rates of 4% to 5% as when it ranges around 2%. An index based on the weighted median of monthly movements in the CPI yields somewhat disconcerting results. Even though some think that the official CPI does not clearly reflect the concept of core inflation, one does not necessarily expect to see such a large gap develop over time.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1998007-eng.pdf,Core Inflation: A Weighted Median Index Archived

The numbers of technologies used by a plant is found to be highly correlated with expected gains in firm performance. The benefits of enhanced food safety and quality, as well as productivity improvements, are closely associated with technology use. Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and ""other"" food product industries.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2002168-eng.pdf,Enhancing Food Safety and Productivity: Technology Use in the Canadian Food Processing Industry Archived

To contribute to the broader goal of minimizing survey nonresponse, this study considers several factors that can impact survey nonresponse, using a 2007 Animal Welfare Survey Conducted in Ohio, USA. In particular, the paper examines the extent to which topic salience and incentives affect survey participation and item nonresponse, drawing on the leverage-saliency theory (Groves, Singer and Corning 2000). We find that participation in a survey is affected by its subject context (as this exerts either positive or negative leverage on sampled units) and prepaid incentives, which is consistent with the leverage-saliency theory. Our expectations are also confirmed by the finding that item nonresponse, our proxy for response quality, does vary by proximity to agriculture and the environment (residential location, knowledge about how food is grown, and views about the importance of animal welfare). However, the data suggests that item nonresponse does not vary according to whether or not a respondent received incentives.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2010001/article/11252-eng.pdf,Examining survey participation and response quality: The significance of topic salience and incentives Archived

It explores the role that certain factors play in conditioning the likelihood of survival - factors related to industry structure, firm demographics and macroeconomic cycles. It asks whether the determinants of failure are different for new start-ups than for firms that have reached adolescence, and if the magnitude of these differences is economically significant. It examines whether, after controlling for certain influences, failure rates differ across industries and provinces. Two themes figure prominently in this analysis. The first is the impact that certain industry characteristics - such as average firm size and concentration - have on the entry/exit process, either through their influence on failure costs or on the intensity of competition. The second centres on how the dimensions of failure evolve over time as new firms gain market experience.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/61-526-X,Failure Rates for New Canadian Firms: New Perspectives on Entry and Exit Archived

These nutrients, need to be replenished in order to ensure that there is something in the soil for the next year’s crops. Canadian agriculture relies heavily on commercial fertilizers as well as manure to replenish soil’s nutrients. This article examines how farmers provide their crops with the nutrients they need to grow and how these farming practices have changed over time.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/96-325-x/2014001/article/13006-eng.htm,Feeding the soil puts food on your plate Archived

Many of these surveys...Description: National Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders .More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-522-x/2006001/article/10453-eng.pdf,Impact of number of repeat 24 hour recall interviews on estimation of usual intakes from food and nutrition surveys Archived

During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone.

The results are mixed. Although the overall relationship between mark-ups and imports is positive across industries for the early 1970s and insignificant for the late 1970s, there is some weak cross-sectional evidence to suggest that imports reduce market power in domestically concentrated industries. Changes in imports between the two periods, however, have a positive impact on mark-ups in concentrated industries. Thus, there is no consistent evidence for Canada that imports have had the beneficial impact on competition that has been emphasized in much of the literature. In contrast, an interesting result of the paper is that increases in exports are associated with reductions in mark-ups, suggesting that exports may have a stronger pro-competitive impact on domestic firms than imports.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2000139-eng.pdf,Import Competition and Market Power: Canadian Evidence Archived

The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined.The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D. Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m1999101-eng.pdf,Innovative Activity in Canadian Food Processing Establishments:  the Importance of Engineering Practices Archived

The ITC country surveys are longitudinal, and their aim is to evaluate the effects of policy measures being introduced in various countries under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The challenges of organization, data collection and analysis in international surveys are reviewed and illustrated. Analysis is an increasingly important part of the motivation for large scale cross-cultural surveys. The fundamental challenge for analysis is to discern the real response (or lack of response) to policy change, separating it from the effects of data collection mode, differential non-response, external events, time-in-sample, culture, and language. Two problems relevant to statistical analysis are discussed. The first problem is the question of when and how to analyze pooled data from several countries, in order to strengthen conclusions which might be generally valid. While in some cases this seems to be straightforward, there are differing opinions on the extent to which pooling is possible and reasonable. It is suggested that for formal comparisons, random effects models are of conceptual use. The second problem is to find models of measurement across cultures and data collection modes which will enable calibration of continuous, binary and ordinal responses, and produce comparisons from which extraneous effects have been removed. It is noted that hierarchical models provide a natural way of relaxing requirements of model invariance across groups.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-522-x/2008000/article/10937-eng.pdf,International surveys: Motives and methodologies Archived

It finds that in most cases the current Canadian...Description: This paper examines the methods of adjustment for quality change made in the Canadian Consumer Price Index for the period 1989 to 1994. It finds that in most cases the current Canadian practice ensures that the replacement of one commodity by another, one variety of a commodity by another, or one outlet by another, has no impact on the overall index. The main exceptions to this result occur when replacing varieties of commodities that are purchased only occasionally, and a judgement is made that the quality ratio between the old and new variety is not the same as the ratio of their prices. In these cases there is an impact on the index, up or down, depending on whether the change in price reported is higher or lower than the change in quality. From the experience of the CPI in these six years there has been a correlation between the price ratio of a variety and its replacement and the index movement that derives from the judgement. The direction and size of the impact on the index depends largely on whether an item is replaced with a higher or lower priced item. For these reasons, the paper argues that more attention should be paid to ensuring that the item selection is more representative of current sales than has traditionally been the case.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1998012-eng.pdf,Item Selection and Quality Change in the Canadian Consumer Price Index Archived

This paper estimates the long-term effect of Colombia's PACES program, which provided over 125,000 poor children with vouchers that covered half the cost of private secondary school. The PACES program presents an unusual opportunity to assess the effect of demand-side education financing in a Latin American country where private schools educate a substantial proportion of pupils. The program is of special interest because many vouchers were assigned by lottery, so program effects can be reliably assessed.We use administrative records to assess the long-term impact of PACES vouchers on high school graduation status and test scores. The principal advantage of administrative records is that there is no loss-to-follow-up and the data are much cheaper than a costly and potentially dangerous survey effort. On the other hand, individual ID numbers may be inaccurate, complicating record linkage, and selection bias contaminates the sample of test-takers. We discuss solutions to these problems. The results suggest that the program increased secondary school completion rates, and that college-entrance test scores were higher for lottery winners than losers.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-522-x/2002001/session5/6726-eng.pdf,Long-term consequences of secondary school vouchers:  Evidence from administrative records in Colombia Archived

During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms.Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-006-x/21-006-x2002008-eng.pdf,More than Just Farming: Employment in Agriculture and Agri-food in Rural and Urban Canada Archived

Nevertheless, organic farming still occupies only a small niche in Canada's agricultural sector.Located mainly in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the organic fruit and vegetable industry is not showing any particular signs of increased producer participation. Still, supermarkets across the country are setting aside ever-larger portions of their produce sections for organic produce, and natural food stores are expanding rapidly. Obviously, there is a niche market driven by consumers concerned with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-004-x/21-004-x2002109-eng.pdf,Organic fruit and vegetable production: is it for you?

Consumers may believe, as a result, that producers of organic food must be receiving more for their product than do their non-organic farming counterparts.Thus, the question begs to be asked: Are organic farmers able to charge more for their produce than non-organic producers? In other words, do organic producers receive a price premium? This is difficult to answer, as there is limited information on prices that farmers receive directly for their produce.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-004-x/2004003/article/6797-eng.pdf,Organic fruit and vegetable production: Is it for you?

One source of this possible error is caused by outlet substitution bias. This type of distortion can result when consumers shift their patronage from one retail outlet to another. As superstores and warehouse type stores continue to open and capture a larger share of the market, the existing CPI sample could become increasingly unrepresentative. If the prices are lower at the new outlets and this decrease in costs is not accurately captured in the CPI, the index will exhibit an upward bias.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m2005018-eng.pdf,Outlet Substitution Bias in the Canadian Consumer Price Index: A Case Study Archived

Interest has grown in the potential uses of this data to improve the quality of price indexes. This paper reports on initial research done in Prices Division. The paper looks at scanner data and the feasibility of its use to produce CPI estimates; evaluates current CPI methodology and procedures; and the impact that use of scanner data would have on the CPI commodity indexes. The main focus of the study, however, is to explore the impact that scanner data would have on the CPI basic commodity indexes covered by scannable items. Since the CPI criterion relates to a limited selection of scanner data, an examination will be made of the impact of gradually relaxing the criteria to include more products and outlets from the scanner data. The initial subset was derived by applying the CPI criteria of volume selling brands and outlets. Each of these changes in criteria yielded a different subset of scanner data. Calculations were performed using these various subsets of scanner data and their results compared to the CPI. An analysis of the results will be used in determining the strengths and limitations of CPI data, detect any deficiencies and provide information for revision of pricing selection.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1998006-eng.pdf,Potential Uses of Scanner Data - A Case Study Using Coffee Data Archived

Furthermore, when some of the more volatile components of the CPI are removed the spread widens. For instance, during the same period core goods inflation (excluding food and energy) increased at an annual rate of 4.3% compared to 6.1% per cent for services (excluding shelter). The literature on service sector inflation suggests five explanations for this phenomenon. Although all these sources of the inflation differential are interesting and important in their own right, this paper will examine two. Some believe that service inflation is a statistical artifact stemming from the inherent difficulties in measuring the output of services and hence their price changes. This issue will be examined first. Indeed the measurement problem appears more serious for services; however it cannot be held completely responsible for the inflationary gap. William Baumol (1967) originally suggested the other cause for higher service inflation whereby unbalanced sectorial growth would be the cause of the divergent inflation rates. This explanation will be the focus of the second part of the paper. In spite of the attractiveness of Baumol's model, empirical evidence rejects the hypothesis.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m1997005-eng.pdf,Service Inflation: Why Is It Higher?

It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-522-x/2006001/article/10396-eng.pdf,Studying scenarios of nutrition intervention: the example of soft drinks Archived

Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products.Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/96-325-x/2014001/article/11921-eng.htm,The changing face of the Canadian fruit and vegetable sector: 1941 to 2011 Archived

The Canadian retail sector has undergone a major transformation in the past ten years with the development of online shopping. Many store based retailers have adopted an omni channel distribution strategy, creating their own e-commerce retail sites, while maintaining a physical store front presence. As one part of this strategy, many store based retailers are continuing to maintain their store fronts at shopping centres. In addition, shopping mall owners are trying to encourage more foot traffic at their malls by rebranding the shopping experience by offering entertainment services and additional food options. As a consequence, information on the sales of retailers located at shopping centres is becoming more important for both shopping centres developers and urban planners.More",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2017104-eng.htm,Where did Vancouverites Go to Shop in 2016?: A Snapshot of Vancouver Retail Store Sales by Shopping Centre Type
