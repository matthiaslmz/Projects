Data are presented for 21 major groups and selected individual industries at the 3- to 6-digit level of detail, as defined by the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), as well as aggregates for durable, non-durable and total manufacturing. Major group industry data are shown with and without adjustment for seasonal variation. Unadjusted shipment totals by province and by major groups within provinces are also shown. These data are used to monitor the business cycle in the manufacturing sector of the economy, to evaluate and develop financial and industrial policy, and to provide market data at the detailed industry level. Related information on manufacturers' opinions on the current state of inventories and orders and about employment and production prospects over the next three months are available from the Business Conditions Survey (BCS). The survey is carried out at the beginning of January, April, July and October. Responses are available approximately five days after the reference month in Statistics Canada's The Daily. The BCS balance of opinion data often serves as a good guide to the direction of change, at least a month in advance of the corresponding quantitative data.More",2005-02-15

Like the original in 1996, this report provides a comprehensive and detailed statistical overview of the health status of Canadians and the major determinants of that status. The original report was created for the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, which has also commissioned this update. The broad purpose of the report is to help policy-makers and program planners identify priority issues and measure progress in the domain of population health.The Statistical report is meant to be a tool for learning as well as planning. The data identify populations at risk; suggest associations between health determinants, health status, and population characteristics; raise questions about the reasons for the widespread differences among the provinces and territories; and illustrate areas where Canada's health information system is robust, and others where it is relatively weak. These and other themes are touched on in the 11 section introductions of the Statistical Report and developed more fully in the companion publication, Toward a healthy future: second report on the health of Canadians.

Industry impacts can be viewed from the perspective of their incidence on other industries or from the perspective of an industry’s dependence on other industries. The data rely on the supply and use tables, which provide the basis for the calculations. Beginning with reference year 2013, a provincial and territorial dimension has been added to the measures. Imports embodied in exports have also been expanded to show their United States (US) and non-US origins.More",2019-04-05
