It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.\", \"Mad Cow Disease and Beef Trade\\nThis paper examines Canada's beef exports and imports throughout the early days of the beef export ban that came into effect on May 20, 2003.

The section on Nutritional awareness explores how aware Canadians are of the nutritional information on packaged food. This infographics also looks at the socio-economic characteristics of those who consult this type of information, how often they do so and for those who do not use them, the reasons for not doing so.', 'Time to eat\\nThis infographic presents results from the 2015 General social Survey on time use, specifically the activity of eating from a time use perspective. The data were collected in a 24 hour diary from respondents 15 years or older. The diary covered the total activities of a day.', 'Protein sources in the Canadian diet, 2015\\nThis infographic presents results from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition, relating to protein sources in the Canadian diet.', \"Let's talk honey\\nThis edition of Canadian Megatrends looks at changes in the production of honey from 1924 to 2014.\", 'Technology Adoption: A Comparison Between Canada and the United States\\nThis study examines differences in technology use in Canada as opposed to the United States as well as reasons for these differences. It examines different aspects of technology use-numbers of technologies used, types of technologies used, as well as regional, size and industry variations in their use. It then investigates differences in benefits that plant managers perceive stem from advanced technology use and differences in the factors that managers assess as impediments. While managers in both countries generally place quite similar emphases on items in the list of benefits received and problems that have impeded adoption, there are significant differences that arise because of the smaller size of the Canadian market.', \"Innovative Activity in Canadian Food Processing Establishments: the Importance of Engineering Practices\\nThis paper examines the factors contributing to innovative activity in the Canadian food processing sector. The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D.; Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.\", 'Enhancing Food Safety and Productivity: Technology Use in the Canadian Food Processing Industry\\nThis paper examines the factors contributing to the adoption of advanced technologies in the Canadian food-processing sector. The numbers of technologies used by a plant is found to be highly correlated with expected gains in firm performance. The benefits of enhanced food safety and quality, as well as productivity improvements, are closely associated with technology use. Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and \"other\" food product industries.', 'Impact of Advanced Technology Use on Firm Performance in the Canadian Food Processing Sector\\nThis paper investigates the evolution of industrial structure in the Canadian food processing sector and its relationship to technological change. It uses 1998 special survey data on advanced technology use, plant characteristics and plant performance.', 'National Tourism Indicators, Quarterly Estimates\\nThe National Tourism Indicators (NTI) are used to monitor supply, demand, employment and GDP for tourism in Canada on a timely basis. Estimates go back to the first quarter of 1986. The indicators are based on benchmarks taken from the Tourism Satellite Accounts. The quarterly statistics are derived using selected components of consumer spending and of GDP by industry and various industry and travel surveys. They are available about 90 days after the reference period. The NTI provide seasonally adjusted, current and constant price estimates, both actual levels and percentage changes. A brief analysis of the quarterly results is included as well as occasional articles. This product was commissioned by the Canadian Tourism Commission to provide quarterly updates for the Tourism Satellite Account.', 'The Canadian tourism satellite account: An analysis of results for 1988 and 1992\\nIn 1994, Statistics Canada published its first estimates of a Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) for the 1988 reference year. In all subsequent work, there has been an ongoing concern on the part of Canadian national accountants with respect to the need for regular updates to the TSA. This article marks the completion of the work involved in updating the TSA for the 1992 reference year and the revisions made to the 1988 year. An analysis of the results as well as a discussion of the structural changes between the two reference years is presented in this paper. In addition, the underlying reasons for the revisions to the previously published 1988 estimates are discussed. A section is also devoted to future developments currently under consideration in the Canadian context, in particular those relating to the development of provincial TSAs for the 1996 reference year.', \"Low Income Cut-offs\\nLow income cut-offs (LICOs) are intended to convey the income level at which a family may be in straitened circumstances because it has to spend a greater portion of its income on the basics (food, clothing and shelter) than does the average family of similar size. The LICOs vary by family size and by size of community. This publication provides a brief explanation of how the LICOs are derived and updated annually. In addition, it provides on a historical basis, LICOs for different family sizes by size of area of residence. LICOs are calculated based on the spending patterns of families on basic 'necessities' - food, shelter and clothing - as collected from the Survey of Household Spending (formerly referred to as the Family Expenditure Survey (FAMEX)).\", \"Canadian Tourism Satellite Account, 2002\\nThis paper highlights the Canadian Tourism Satellite Account (CTSA) developed by Statistics Canada. The CTSA provides an economic measure of the importance of tourism in terms of expenditures, Gross Domestic Product and employment for Canada.

Materials such as food waste and leaf and yard trimmings are often composted at home using compost bins or they are collected curbside and processed at centralized composting facilities. The study examines composting in Canada using data from the Waste Management Industry Survey and the Households and the Environment Survey.', \"Greenhouse gas emissions: a focus on Canadian households\\nHouseholds contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada both directly and indirectly. Direct emissions occur through the use of motor fuel and residential fuel, while indirect emissions result from the production of goods and services purchased by households. This article examines households' direct and indirect GHG emissions from 1990 to 2004.\", \"Fresh water resources in Canada\\nWater is a basic necessity of life: access to clean water in sufficient quantity is an integral part of our well-being. It has had a strong influence on Canada's development as a country and remains a precious part of our natural resource wealth. While Canadians live in a country with a plentiful supply of fresh water, they are also concerned about a number of water-related issues. These include the availability, distribution, use and quality of water, as well as the controls placed on water usage. This article examines these issues by creating a statistical portrait of Canada's fresh water resources.\", 'Food in Canada\\nThe feature article, Food in Canada, begins with a brief historical perspective on fishing and farming in Canada and moves on to explore the impact of the food system on the economy, environment and society. It illustrates how the contribution of the food system to gross domestic product and employment has shifted over the past forty years, and investigates the impact of primary food production on land, water, air and climate. The article concludes with a characterization of what is on the Canadian table, and the greenhouse gas emissions and energy-use associated with household food purchases.', 'Agriculture in Canada\\nThe 2014 article \"Agriculture in Canada\" gathers together a variety of statistics describing agriculture from the perspective of ecosystem goods and services.The article addresses the ecological infrastructure supporting agricultural activity (Section 2), ecosystem goods and services from agriculture (Section 3), the main beneficiaries of these goods and services (Section 4) and the environmental impacts and management activities associated with agriculture (Section 5). Section 6 provides an example to illustrate how agricultural information can be integrated into a system of environmental accounts that follow international guidelines being developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Section 7 concludes with a short listing of areas requiring further research.', 'Results from the 2011 Functional Foods and Natural Health Products Survey\\nReports on Special Business Projects is an occasional series that focuses primarily on the results of special surveys or special projects conducted by the Centre for Special Business Projects. The reports cover a wide range of topics, which include business performance and trends, custom tabulations of business data, economic impact studies, new measurement frameworks and indicators to support program development, monitoring and performance assessment, territorial economic indicators and other special studies.', 'VISTA on the Agri-food Industry and the Farm Community\\nEach issue contains a short article highlighting statistical insights on themes relating to agriculture, food and rural issues.', 'Fresh fruit and vegetable supplies are seasonal and so are the prices\\nCanadian farmers are successfully meeting the demand for fresh fruit and vegetables during the local growing season. Due to the short duration of the growing season however, imports are required to fill the shelves for a significant part of the year. Although overall prices for fresh produce are trending downwards, these imports cost more in the grocery stores and fresh markets than domestic produce.', 'Gross output in aquaculture exceeds half a billion dollars annually\\nThe development of aquaculture parallels the transition that occured in agriculture several thousand years ago. Agriculture appeared when hunters and gatherers began to raise livestock and plant crops to produce food. The parallel transition with aquatic species is becoming an important activity in the Canadian economy. As a result of new initiatives, Statistics Canada is now able to provide economic data for the developing industry of aquaculture.', 'Livestock concentrations - Where are they?\\nThis article gives a \"snapshot\" of where the larger concentrations of livestock were in May 1996. This information would be useful to planners, investors, non-governmental organizations, rural communities, and governments. This could help them decide where to expand livestock production without putting the environment at risk.', 'Corn and soybeans grown from genetically modified seed are not unusual\\nThe most widely discussed agricultural topic in recent years is the risks and opportunities presented by food products obtained through biotechnology, especially those derived from genetically modified seeds (GMS). According to the June 2000 survey on field crops, 16% of all soybean acreage in Quebec, and 18% of that in Ontario, was planted with genetically modified seeds. The percentage of corn in both provinces was 27%. Most farms using GMS corn and soybeans are located in Ontario and Quebec where the production of both of these crops is concentrated.', 'Businesses in the food chain survive the turmoil of the 1990s\\nFood manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers have managed to sustain reasonable returns during the 1990s despite the challenges posed by the advent of free trade agreements and the changing eating habits of the population. This article looks at the returns on investment for businesses operating in the domestic food sector during the 1990s.', \"Organic fruit and vegetable production: is it for you?\\nIncreasing numbers of consumers have come to believe in the perceived value and quality available in organic foods. Nevertheless, organic farming still occupies only a small niche in Canada's agricultural sector. Located mainly in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the organic fruit and vegetable industry is not showing any particular signs of increased producer participation. Still, supermarkets across the country are setting aside ever-larger portions of their produce sections for organic produce, and natural food stores are expanding rapidly. Obviously, there is a niche market driven by consumers concerned with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\", 'Canadian farm families more dependant on off-farm income\\nTotal income of farm families is derived from 1999 personal income tax returns of family members. The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than \"married\" or \"living common-law\" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over. Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation. In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article.', 'Genetically modified crops: Steady growth in Ontario and Quebec\\nSince their introduction in the mid-1990s, genetically modified seeds have become increasingly popular among Eastern Canadian corn and soybean producers. These producers use the seeds to limit insect damage to crops, or to provide their crops with a resistance to herbicides that would otherwise kill the plants. Statistics Canada has collected data on genetically modified soybeans and corn in Quebec and Ontario for the past three years. In its field crop surveys, the Agency has tracked plantings, harvestings, production and expected yields for soybeans and corn grown from genetically modified seeds.', 'The expansion of large livestock farms between 1991 and 2001\\nOver the last few years, the rapid expansion of large livestock operations has fuelled heated debates in many rural communities across Canada. Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. Promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution. However, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life in association with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario. Still others are upset by prospects of added truck traffic, dust and noise resulting from feed and livestock transportation.', \"High-tech vegetables: Canada's booming greenhouse vegetable industry\\nThis article analyzes the phenomenal growth in Canadian greenhouse operations, focusing on tomatoes because they are the most significant vegetable crop, both in terms of volume and value. It also looks at trade disputes with the United States as well as the impact of exchange rates on the greenhouse vegetable sales.\", 'Niche market or an expanding industry? Organic fruit and vegetable production in Canada\\nThis paper will be a descriptive analysis of the organic fruit and vegetable data collected between 2000 and 2003.', 'The urban-rural clash: Environmental management systems on Canadian farms\\nFor the purposes of this study, eight environmental management systems (EMSs) were considered: whole farm environmental plan; manure management plan; fertilizer management plan; pesticide management plan; water management plan; wildlife conservation plan; grazing management plan, and nutrient management plan. The information on the use of farm environmental plans was obtained from the Farm Environmental Management Survey (FEMS) conducted in 2001 by Statistics Canada and sponsored in part by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.', 'Potatoes: Changing production, changing consumption\\nThis paper examines the history of the potato, and identifies the shifts in markets that have caused these changes.', \"Taking stock: A profile of Canada's aquaculture industry\\nThis article examines aquaculture in Canada during the past few years, as well as its place in world markets, the species that dominate our production and its importance for certain regions.

This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.\", 'Economic Overview of Farm Incomes\\nThis series of 11 bulletins produced jointly by Statistics Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada offers readers an analytical and illustrative presentation of farm financial data. Data from Revenue Canada taxation of unincorporated and incorporated farms and other agricultural surveys provide the statistical basis for these bulletins. Eight of these bulletins feature a specific farm type providing analysis on such key variables as revenues and expenses, net operating income and net operating margins. Physical characteristics such as crop areas and livestock inventory numbers as well as some distributional data are presented. The first bulletin of this series provides an overview of all farm types combined. The two remaining bulletins present sources and levels of off-farm income for farm operators and farm families for selected farm types. Depending on the variables, the discussion is presented by province or by revenue class. Comparisons of financial performance are also made for selected variables. Tables and graphs support the analytical texts.', 'Grain and oilseed farms\\nThis bulletin provides a detailed analysis of farm structure and financial performance of grain and oilseed farms and farm operators, by revenue class and by province.', 'Rural and Urban Household Expenditure Patterns for 1996\\nA defining feature of rural populations is that they are distant from major metropolitan centres. Thus, households in rural areas have different needs than those in urban areas and, therefore, different spending patterns. In 1996, the total expenditure of an average Canadian household was $49,054. Rural households spent an average of $42,620 while urban households had an average spending of $50,283. This article gives an overview of the differences and similarities in the spending patterns of rural and urban households.', 'Employment Structure in Rural and Small Town Canada: The Primary Sector\\nThe rural employment picture is changing quickly in Canada. As in most western nations, primary industries in Canada are losing jobs. This provides a challenge to national, provincial and local decision-makers to find new goods and services to export in order to help stabilise the employment levels in communities that are dependent upon primary sector employment. The purpose of this bulletin is to investigate the changing structure of primary sector employment in rural Canada in the 1980s and the 1990s. Specifically, we look at employment in the agricultural industry and employment in all other primary industries (i.e. fishing, logging and forestry, mining and oil and natural gas extraction, and hunting and trapping).', \"More than Just Farming: Employment in Agriculture and Agri-food in Rural and Urban Canada\\nWhile the number of census-farms and farm operators is shrinking, the number of jobs in the agriculture and agri-food industry is growing. During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms. Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing.\", 'Food Statistics\\nThis publication contains information on food available for consumption and food nutrition.', 'Manure Storage in Canada\\nSustainable development and environmental health are priorities of the agriculture sector. Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize risk to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The 2001 Farm Environmental Management Survey (FEMS), conducted by Statistics Canada in March 2002, was carried out on behalf of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in order to measure current farm environmental initiatives and farming practices. The survey collected information from 16,000 farmers on the management of manure, grazing systems, crop nutrients, pesticides, soil and water, as well as whole farm environmental management.', 'Grazing Management in Canada\\nGrazing Management in Canada presents information on various characteristics of livestock grazing management as practised on Canadian farms. Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize pollution risks to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The FEMS results presented here provide an overview of grazing practices. However, management practices that could be protective or detrimental to the environment and that relate to grazing systems are much broader than those included in this bulletin. Further, regional differences in climate and soil quality mean that there is no \"optimal\" or \"correct\" grazing practice that is applicable throughout the whole country or even within an individual province. In this paper, discussion focuses on farms with grazing cattle that derive 51% or more of their gross farm receipts from either beef or dairy production. Results show that grazing management practice varies by region of Canada and by farm size.', \"Fertilizer Shipments Survey\\nThe Fertilizer Shipments Survey is a mandatory Statistics Canada survey conducted by Agriculture Division on behalf of the Canadian Fertilizer Institute and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, starting in 2008. The information from this survey is essential to AAFC to support Canada's international reporting obligations of inventory of Greenhouse Gas emissions governed by the terms of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol agreements. The survey produces statistics on shipments of fertilizer in Canada by manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retail distributors. This survey is a continuation of a survey that was conducted by the Canadian Fertilizer Institute, which covers all major Canadian manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retail distributors. Aggregate data will be used by analysts to determine the province of destination for fertilizer products manufactured in Canada or imported into Canada, by product type and by nutrient content. Tables will also be provided for fertilizer production at the Canada level and for market inventories for East and West.\", 'Farming Facts\\nFarming Facts is published by the Agriculture Division of Statistics Canada to illustrate the variety of information produced by the organization for the agricultural community.

Hotels, travel agencies, airlines and restaurants are to varying degrees affected by tourism. Thus, tourism is not just one industry, but an amalgam of several, and the tourism phenomenon raises a number of questions because of its complexity, its various ramifications and its scope.', 'Tourism service industries\\nThis chapter describes three specific industry sectors, all very important to tourism: traveller accomodation services, food services and drinking places, travel agencies and tour operators. These sectors generated just over half of the goods and services purchased by all visitors in Canada in 1999.', \"Technology and performance in Canadian food processing\\nFood processing is one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries, consisting of more than 3,000 establishments. Employing close to 230,000 people in 1998, it boasted a gross domestic product of $15 billion that same year. The relationship between the use of advanced manufacturing technology and firm performance during the 1990s, as measured by growth in labour productivity and growth in market share, is the subject of a recently released Statistics Canada study, which finds that a high-technology orientation is closely associated with success.\", 'Functional foods and nutraceuticals industry in Canada\\nResults from the Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals Survey 2005 indicate that there were 389 firms in Canada engaged in activities related to either functional foods, nutraceuticals or both during 2004/05. This article provides highlights of a group of firms which generates $29 billion in revenues and employs over 50,000 persons.', 'Advanced Technology in the Canadian Food Industry\\nThe food-processing industry benefits from a wide a range of new advanced technologies. Technological advances include computer-based information and control systems, as well as sophisticated processing and packaging methods that enhance product quality, improve food safety and reduce costs. Continuous quality improvement and benchmarking are examples of related business practices. This study examines the use of advanced technologies in the food-processing industry. It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology. Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology. Firms that differ in size and nationality choose to pursue different technological strategies. This study focuses on how these differences are reflected in the different use of technology for large and small establishments, for foreign and domestic plants and for plants in different industries.', 'Results from the Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals Survey - 2005\\nThis working paper profiles Canadian firms involved in the production and distribution of functional foods and/or nutraceuticals (FFN).

An integrated life course and social determinants model of Aboriginal health framework is used to guide the analysis.', \"The soybean, agriculture's jack-of-all-trades, is gaining ground across Canada\\nUntil the mid-1970s, soybeans were restricted by climate primarily to southern Ontario. Intensive breeding programs have since opened up more widespread growing possibilities for this incredibly versatile crop in Canada: The 1.2 million hectares of soybeans reported on the Census of Agriculture in 2006 marked a near eightfold increase in area since 1976, the year the ground-breaking varieties that perform well in Canada's shorter growing season were introduced.\", 'Bison on the comeback trail\\nThe once scarce bison population continues to grow on Canadian farms. According to the 2006 Census of Agriculture, the bison herd, at 195,728 head, has increased 34.9% since 2001.', 'Organic: from niche to mainstream\\nWith growing consumer demand and increasing visibility, many organic food products in Canada are being showcased in grocery stores, natural food stores, farmers markets and in community-supported agriculture projects. For consumers the challenge is to know what organic really means. Is it the same as certified organic? How large is the market for organic food in Canada and what are farmers doing to address the demand? This article provides insight on this rapidly evolving organic food sector of agriculture in Canada.', \"That beet is sweet!\\nSugar beets, significantly established in Canada in the first half of the 20th century, continue to sweeten things for farmers in Ontario and Alberta, according to Census of Agriculture data. Although Canada's sugar beet area in 2006, at 19,488 hectares, is only half the 1951 peak, the crop continues to thrive in Alberta, and has made a comeback in Ontario, a province where it had not been significant for decades.\", 'Fork in the road: Canadian agriculture and food on the move\\nFood is as much a necessity as the air we breathe and the water we drink. But do we know where our food comes from, and what it takes to get it into our kitchens? The question of where our food is grown or processed is coming under increased scrutiny, not just in Canada but in other countries, including our trading partners. Concerns underlying this increased focus include discussions of energy consumption required for food transport, environmental concerns, product safety, food security and food costs. The article, Fork in the Road, takes a look at the trade in food and shows how Canadians can find out what foods are being produced in their local area.', \"Turkey industry adapting to new Canadian demographics\\nThink fast, what's the first food you think of when someone says Thanksgiving dinner'? Most people would be quick to reply turkey of course. Increasingly, though, turkeys are no longer solely associated with Thanksgiving or Christmas and can be found year-round in our grocery stores and on our tables. In 2006, the Census of Agriculture identified 3,174 Canadian farms reported 7.7 million turkeys on their operations.\", 'Sour cherries in Canada\\nWhat could be better than a home-made cherry pie coming fresh out of the oven, with the wonderful smell of rich cherries and bright red juice. Historically there have been two main types of cherries; sweet cherries which we eat fresh from the tree and farmers markets in the summer, and sour cherries, which we find in a variety of processed forms. Sour cherries are aptly named for their sour flavour compared to the regular sweet cherries. Canadian plant breeders have been working to produce a third type of cherry, one that combines the best traits of both sweet and sour cherries.', 'Canola: a Canadian success story\\nWith its vibrant yellow flowers, a canola field is a beautiful sight. And its colour is a clue to its family history mustard. Canola refers to a particular group of rapeseed varieties, a species of the much larger mustard family that includes, besides mustard, turnips, cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli. While these plants have been bred for their roots (turnips), leaves (cabbage) or immature flower heads (cauliflower and broccoli), the rapeseed branch of the family was bred to maximize production of the high-oil seeds that are used to produce vegetable oil.', \"Corn: Canada's third most valuable crop\\nFarmers and corn breeders have developed multiple varieties suited to particular uses and adapted to distinct environments. In Canada, three broad types of corn dominate farmers' fields: corn for grain, corn for silage, and sweet corn.\", 'The changing face of the Canadian fruit and vegetable sector: 1941 to 2011\\nHorticulture is a type of agriculture that encompasses a wide range of crop production. Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products. Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.', \"Feeding the soil puts food on your plate\\nAs crops grow, they deplete the soil's fertility by absorbing nutrients from the land. These nutrients, need to be replenished in order to ensure that there is something in the soil for the next year's crops. Canadian agriculture relies heavily on commercial fertilizers as well as manure to replenish soil's nutrients. This article examines how farmers provide their crops with the nutrients they need to grow and how these farming practices have changed over time.\", 'The Changing Face of the Canadian Hog Industry\\nThe Canadian hog industry has changed greatly over the years. Data collected by the Census of Agriculture show that the industry has undergone a radical transformation. It has evolved from being an industry with a very large number of mixed farms, each possessing only a few pigs, to one with fewer large and highly specialized farms. It now plays a major role in exports and is constantly improving in terms of technology.', 'Pulses in Canada\\nA pulse is an edible seed harvested from the pod of a variety of annual leguminous plants. Pulses grown in Canada include, mainly, dry beans, dry peas, lentils and chickpeas. Pulse area and production in Canada has increased since the 1980s, making the country one of the leading producers and exporters of pulses worldwide.', 'Dairy goats in Ontario: a growing industry\\nThe number of goats for dairy on agricultural operations in Ontario is increasing as farmers expand and optimize production. When compared to other agricultural operations in the province, dairy goat operations can differ in terms of demographic, geographic, financial and organizational characteristics.', 'Other livestock and poultry in Canada\\nWhile Canadian livestock is often associated with more traditional sectors such as cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry, Canadian farms raise a host of other livestock and poultry. Other livestock include, for example, horses, donkeys, rabbits and deer. Other livestock and poultry can be found on a variety of operations, with varying demographic and financial characteristics.', 'Innovation and healthy living propel growth in certain other crops\\nWith increasing attention on health-conscious agricultural products, farm operations are focusing on particular varieties of \"other crops\" to try and meet consumer needs. \"Other crops\" encompass both fruits and vegetables, as well as field crops.

The survey's main objective was to estimate the distributions of Canadians' usual dietary intake at the provincial level for 15 age-sex groups. Such distributions are generally estimated with the SIDE application, but with the choices that were made concerning sample design and method of estimating sampling variability, obtaining those estimates is not a simple matter. This article describes the methodological challenges in estimating usual intake distributions from the survey data using SIDE.\", 'Impact of telephone versus face to face repeat 24-hour recall interviews on food and nutrition surveys\\nMany population surveys collecting food consumption data use 24 hour recall methodology to capture detailed one day intakes. In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews.', 'Impact of number of repeat 24 hour recall interviews on estimation of usual intakes from food and nutrition surveys\\nNational Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders .', 'Regression weighting in the presence of nonresponse with application to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey\\nA regression weight generation procedure is applied to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Regression estimation was used because of the large nonresponse in the survey. The regression weights are generalized least squares weights modified so that all weights are positive and so that large weights are smaller than the least squares weights. It is demonstrated that the regression estimator has the potential for large reductions in mean square error relative to the simple direct estimator in the presence of nonresponse.', 'Balancing sample design goals for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is one of a series of health-related programs sponsored by the United States National Center for Health Statistics. A unique feature of NHANES is the administration of a complete medical examination for each respondent in the sample. To standardize administration, these examinations are carried out in mobile examination centers. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors. The sample design for NHANES must create a balance between the requirements for efficient annual and multiyear samples and the flexibility that allows changes in key design parameters to make the survey more responsive to the needs of the research and health policy communities. This paper discusses the challenges involved in designing and implementing a sample selection process that satisfies the goals of NHANES.', \"Measuring Industry Concentration in Canada's Food Processing Sectors\\nThe objective of this study is to provide up-to-date measures of the concentration of the manufacturing industries in the Canadian food-processing sector.\", 'Comparative Study of Analytical Consumer Price Indexes for Different Subgroups of the Reference Population\\nThe reference population for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been represented, since the 1992 updating of the basket of goods and services, by families and unattached individuals living in private urban or rural households. The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers. Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada. In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level. The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population.', 'Using Median Expenditures: Impact on Household Spending Data\\nThis paper provides some guidance to users on the use of medians and also gives some examples of situations when it can be a more appropriate measure than the average.', \"2001 Food Expenditure Survey, Data Quality Indicators\\nThe Food Expenditure Survey (FES) is a periodic survey collecting data from households on food spending habits.

This note documents the shift in farming towards floriculture and nursery products in recent years, including which provinces have driven their growth and why farmers find these crops more appealing.', 'Food prices: A boon for producers, a buffer for consumers\\nCanada stands to profit from the surge in food prices. Producers already have seen food exports hit a record high early in 2008. While consumers pay more for bread and cereals, this has been offset by stable or lower prices for other foodstuffs.', \"Studying scenarios of nutrition intervention: the example of soft drinks\\nUsing data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, it is possible to estimate the distributions of usual nutrient intake. It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item.\", \"Mad Cow Disease and Beef Trade\\nThis paper examines Canada's beef exports and imports throughout the early days of the beef export ban that came into effect on May 20, 2003.

The section on Nutritional awareness explores how aware Canadians are of the nutritional information on packaged food. This infographics also looks at the socio-economic characteristics of those who consult this type of information, how often they do so and for those who do not use them, the reasons for not doing so.', 'Time to eat\\nThis infographic presents results from the 2015 General social Survey on time use, specifically the activity of eating from a time use perspective. The data were collected in a 24 hour diary from respondents 15 years or older. The diary covered the total activities of a day.', 'Protein sources in the Canadian diet, 2015\\nThis infographic presents results from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition, relating to protein sources in the Canadian diet.', \"Let's talk honey\\nThis edition of Canadian Megatrends looks at changes in the production of honey from 1924 to 2014.\", 'Technology Adoption: A Comparison Between Canada and the United States\\nThis study examines differences in technology use in Canada as opposed to the United States as well as reasons for these differences. It examines different aspects of technology use-numbers of technologies used, types of technologies used, as well as regional, size and industry variations in their use. It then investigates differences in benefits that plant managers perceive stem from advanced technology use and differences in the factors that managers assess as impediments. While managers in both countries generally place quite similar emphases on items in the list of benefits received and problems that have impeded adoption, there are significant differences that arise because of the smaller size of the Canadian market.', \"Innovative Activity in Canadian Food Processing Establishments: the Importance of Engineering Practices\\nThis paper examines the factors contributing to innovative activity in the Canadian food processing sector. The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D.; Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.\", 'Enhancing Food Safety and Productivity: Technology Use in the Canadian Food Processing Industry\\nThis paper examines the factors contributing to the adoption of advanced technologies in the Canadian food-processing sector. The numbers of technologies used by a plant is found to be highly correlated with expected gains in firm performance. The benefits of enhanced food safety and quality, as well as productivity improvements, are closely associated with technology use. Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and \"other\" food product industries.', 'Impact of Advanced Technology Use on Firm Performance in the Canadian Food Processing Sector\\nThis paper investigates the evolution of industrial structure in the Canadian food processing sector and its relationship to technological change. It uses 1998 special survey data on advanced technology use, plant characteristics and plant performance.', 'National Tourism Indicators, Quarterly Estimates\\nThe National Tourism Indicators (NTI) are used to monitor supply, demand, employment and GDP for tourism in Canada on a timely basis. Estimates go back to the first quarter of 1986. The indicators are based on benchmarks taken from the Tourism Satellite Accounts. The quarterly statistics are derived using selected components of consumer spending and of GDP by industry and various industry and travel surveys. They are available about 90 days after the reference period. The NTI provide seasonally adjusted, current and constant price estimates, both actual levels and percentage changes. A brief analysis of the quarterly results is included as well as occasional articles. This product was commissioned by the Canadian Tourism Commission to provide quarterly updates for the Tourism Satellite Account.', 'The Canadian tourism satellite account: An analysis of results for 1988 and 1992\\nIn 1994, Statistics Canada published its first estimates of a Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) for the 1988 reference year. In all subsequent work, there has been an ongoing concern on the part of Canadian national accountants with respect to the need for regular updates to the TSA. This article marks the completion of the work involved in updating the TSA for the 1992 reference year and the revisions made to the 1988 year. An analysis of the results as well as a discussion of the structural changes between the two reference years is presented in this paper. In addition, the underlying reasons for the revisions to the previously published 1988 estimates are discussed. A section is also devoted to future developments currently under consideration in the Canadian context, in particular those relating to the development of provincial TSAs for the 1996 reference year.', \"Low Income Cut-offs\\nLow income cut-offs (LICOs) are intended to convey the income level at which a family may be in straitened circumstances because it has to spend a greater portion of its income on the basics (food, clothing and shelter) than does the average family of similar size. The LICOs vary by family size and by size of community. This publication provides a brief explanation of how the LICOs are derived and updated annually. In addition, it provides on a historical basis, LICOs for different family sizes by size of area of residence. LICOs are calculated based on the spending patterns of families on basic 'necessities' - food, shelter and clothing - as collected from the Survey of Household Spending (formerly referred to as the Family Expenditure Survey (FAMEX)).\", \"Canadian Tourism Satellite Account, 2002\\nThis paper highlights the Canadian Tourism Satellite Account (CTSA) developed by Statistics Canada. The CTSA provides an economic measure of the importance of tourism in terms of expenditures, Gross Domestic Product and employment for Canada.

Materials such as food waste and leaf and yard trimmings are often composted at home using compost bins or they are collected curbside and processed at centralized composting facilities. The study examines composting in Canada using data from the Waste Management Industry Survey and the Households and the Environment Survey.', \"Greenhouse gas emissions: a focus on Canadian households\\nHouseholds contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada both directly and indirectly. Direct emissions occur through the use of motor fuel and residential fuel, while indirect emissions result from the production of goods and services purchased by households. This article examines households' direct and indirect GHG emissions from 1990 to 2004.\", \"Fresh water resources in Canada\\nWater is a basic necessity of life: access to clean water in sufficient quantity is an integral part of our well-being. It has had a strong influence on Canada's development as a country and remains a precious part of our natural resource wealth. While Canadians live in a country with a plentiful supply of fresh water, they are also concerned about a number of water-related issues. These include the availability, distribution, use and quality of water, as well as the controls placed on water usage. This article examines these issues by creating a statistical portrait of Canada's fresh water resources.\", 'Food in Canada\\nThe feature article, Food in Canada, begins with a brief historical perspective on fishing and farming in Canada and moves on to explore the impact of the food system on the economy, environment and society. It illustrates how the contribution of the food system to gross domestic product and employment has shifted over the past forty years, and investigates the impact of primary food production on land, water, air and climate. The article concludes with a characterization of what is on the Canadian table, and the greenhouse gas emissions and energy-use associated with household food purchases.', 'Agriculture in Canada\\nThe 2014 article \"Agriculture in Canada\" gathers together a variety of statistics describing agriculture from the perspective of ecosystem goods and services.The article addresses the ecological infrastructure supporting agricultural activity (Section 2), ecosystem goods and services from agriculture (Section 3), the main beneficiaries of these goods and services (Section 4) and the environmental impacts and management activities associated with agriculture (Section 5). Section 6 provides an example to illustrate how agricultural information can be integrated into a system of environmental accounts that follow international guidelines being developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Section 7 concludes with a short listing of areas requiring further research.', 'Results from the 2011 Functional Foods and Natural Health Products Survey\\nReports on Special Business Projects is an occasional series that focuses primarily on the results of special surveys or special projects conducted by the Centre for Special Business Projects. The reports cover a wide range of topics, which include business performance and trends, custom tabulations of business data, economic impact studies, new measurement frameworks and indicators to support program development, monitoring and performance assessment, territorial economic indicators and other special studies.', 'VISTA on the Agri-food Industry and the Farm Community\\nEach issue contains a short article highlighting statistical insights on themes relating to agriculture, food and rural issues.', 'Fresh fruit and vegetable supplies are seasonal and so are the prices\\nCanadian farmers are successfully meeting the demand for fresh fruit and vegetables during the local growing season. Due to the short duration of the growing season however, imports are required to fill the shelves for a significant part of the year. Although overall prices for fresh produce are trending downwards, these imports cost more in the grocery stores and fresh markets than domestic produce.', 'Gross output in aquaculture exceeds half a billion dollars annually\\nThe development of aquaculture parallels the transition that occured in agriculture several thousand years ago. Agriculture appeared when hunters and gatherers began to raise livestock and plant crops to produce food. The parallel transition with aquatic species is becoming an important activity in the Canadian economy. As a result of new initiatives, Statistics Canada is now able to provide economic data for the developing industry of aquaculture.', 'Livestock concentrations - Where are they?\\nThis article gives a \"snapshot\" of where the larger concentrations of livestock were in May 1996. This information would be useful to planners, investors, non-governmental organizations, rural communities, and governments. This could help them decide where to expand livestock production without putting the environment at risk.', 'Corn and soybeans grown from genetically modified seed are not unusual\\nThe most widely discussed agricultural topic in recent years is the risks and opportunities presented by food products obtained through biotechnology, especially those derived from genetically modified seeds (GMS). According to the June 2000 survey on field crops, 16% of all soybean acreage in Quebec, and 18% of that in Ontario, was planted with genetically modified seeds. The percentage of corn in both provinces was 27%. Most farms using GMS corn and soybeans are located in Ontario and Quebec where the production of both of these crops is concentrated.', 'Businesses in the food chain survive the turmoil of the 1990s\\nFood manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers have managed to sustain reasonable returns during the 1990s despite the challenges posed by the advent of free trade agreements and the changing eating habits of the population. This article looks at the returns on investment for businesses operating in the domestic food sector during the 1990s.', \"Organic fruit and vegetable production: is it for you?\\nIncreasing numbers of consumers have come to believe in the perceived value and quality available in organic foods. Nevertheless, organic farming still occupies only a small niche in Canada's agricultural sector. Located mainly in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the organic fruit and vegetable industry is not showing any particular signs of increased producer participation. Still, supermarkets across the country are setting aside ever-larger portions of their produce sections for organic produce, and natural food stores are expanding rapidly. Obviously, there is a niche market driven by consumers concerned with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\", 'Canadian farm families more dependant on off-farm income\\nTotal income of farm families is derived from 1999 personal income tax returns of family members. The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than \"married\" or \"living common-law\" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over. Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation. In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article.', 'Genetically modified crops: Steady growth in Ontario and Quebec\\nSince their introduction in the mid-1990s, genetically modified seeds have become increasingly popular among Eastern Canadian corn and soybean producers. These producers use the seeds to limit insect damage to crops, or to provide their crops with a resistance to herbicides that would otherwise kill the plants. Statistics Canada has collected data on genetically modified soybeans and corn in Quebec and Ontario for the past three years. In its field crop surveys, the Agency has tracked plantings, harvestings, production and expected yields for soybeans and corn grown from genetically modified seeds.', 'The expansion of large livestock farms between 1991 and 2001\\nOver the last few years, the rapid expansion of large livestock operations has fuelled heated debates in many rural communities across Canada. Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. Promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution. However, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life in association with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario. Still others are upset by prospects of added truck traffic, dust and noise resulting from feed and livestock transportation.', \"High-tech vegetables: Canada's booming greenhouse vegetable industry\\nThis article analyzes the phenomenal growth in Canadian greenhouse operations, focusing on tomatoes because they are the most significant vegetable crop, both in terms of volume and value. It also looks at trade disputes with the United States as well as the impact of exchange rates on the greenhouse vegetable sales.\", 'Niche market or an expanding industry? Organic fruit and vegetable production in Canada\\nThis paper will be a descriptive analysis of the organic fruit and vegetable data collected between 2000 and 2003.', 'The urban-rural clash: Environmental management systems on Canadian farms\\nFor the purposes of this study, eight environmental management systems (EMSs) were considered: whole farm environmental plan; manure management plan; fertilizer management plan; pesticide management plan; water management plan; wildlife conservation plan; grazing management plan, and nutrient management plan. The information on the use of farm environmental plans was obtained from the Farm Environmental Management Survey (FEMS) conducted in 2001 by Statistics Canada and sponsored in part by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.', 'Potatoes: Changing production, changing consumption\\nThis paper examines the history of the potato, and identifies the shifts in markets that have caused these changes.', \"Taking stock: A profile of Canada's aquaculture industry\\nThis article examines aquaculture in Canada during the past few years, as well as its place in world markets, the species that dominate our production and its importance for certain regions.

This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.\", 'Economic Overview of Farm Incomes\\nThis series of 11 bulletins produced jointly by Statistics Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada offers readers an analytical and illustrative presentation of farm financial data. Data from Revenue Canada taxation of unincorporated and incorporated farms and other agricultural surveys provide the statistical basis for these bulletins. Eight of these bulletins feature a specific farm type providing analysis on such key variables as revenues and expenses, net operating income and net operating margins. Physical characteristics such as crop areas and livestock inventory numbers as well as some distributional data are presented. The first bulletin of this series provides an overview of all farm types combined. The two remaining bulletins present sources and levels of off-farm income for farm operators and farm families for selected farm types. Depending on the variables, the discussion is presented by province or by revenue class. Comparisons of financial performance are also made for selected variables. Tables and graphs support the analytical texts.', 'Grain and oilseed farms\\nThis bulletin provides a detailed analysis of farm structure and financial performance of grain and oilseed farms and farm operators, by revenue class and by province.', 'Rural and Urban Household Expenditure Patterns for 1996\\nA defining feature of rural populations is that they are distant from major metropolitan centres. Thus, households in rural areas have different needs than those in urban areas and, therefore, different spending patterns. In 1996, the total expenditure of an average Canadian household was $49,054. Rural households spent an average of $42,620 while urban households had an average spending of $50,283. This article gives an overview of the differences and similarities in the spending patterns of rural and urban households.', 'Employment Structure in Rural and Small Town Canada: The Primary Sector\\nThe rural employment picture is changing quickly in Canada. As in most western nations, primary industries in Canada are losing jobs. This provides a challenge to national, provincial and local decision-makers to find new goods and services to export in order to help stabilise the employment levels in communities that are dependent upon primary sector employment. The purpose of this bulletin is to investigate the changing structure of primary sector employment in rural Canada in the 1980s and the 1990s. Specifically, we look at employment in the agricultural industry and employment in all other primary industries (i.e. fishing, logging and forestry, mining and oil and natural gas extraction, and hunting and trapping).', \"More than Just Farming: Employment in Agriculture and Agri-food in Rural and Urban Canada\\nWhile the number of census-farms and farm operators is shrinking, the number of jobs in the agriculture and agri-food industry is growing. During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms. Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing.\", 'Food Statistics\\nThis publication contains information on food available for consumption and food nutrition.', 'Manure Storage in Canada\\nSustainable development and environmental health are priorities of the agriculture sector. Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize risk to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The 2001 Farm Environmental Management Survey (FEMS), conducted by Statistics Canada in March 2002, was carried out on behalf of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in order to measure current farm environmental initiatives and farming practices. The survey collected information from 16,000 farmers on the management of manure, grazing systems, crop nutrients, pesticides, soil and water, as well as whole farm environmental management.', 'Grazing Management in Canada\\nGrazing Management in Canada presents information on various characteristics of livestock grazing management as practised on Canadian farms. Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize pollution risks to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The FEMS results presented here provide an overview of grazing practices. However, management practices that could be protective or detrimental to the environment and that relate to grazing systems are much broader than those included in this bulletin. Further, regional differences in climate and soil quality mean that there is no \"optimal\" or \"correct\" grazing practice that is applicable throughout the whole country or even within an individual province. In this paper, discussion focuses on farms with grazing cattle that derive 51% or more of their gross farm receipts from either beef or dairy production. Results show that grazing management practice varies by region of Canada and by farm size.', \"Fertilizer Shipments Survey\\nThe Fertilizer Shipments Survey is a mandatory Statistics Canada survey conducted by Agriculture Division on behalf of the Canadian Fertilizer Institute and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, starting in 2008. The information from this survey is essential to AAFC to support Canada's international reporting obligations of inventory of Greenhouse Gas emissions governed by the terms of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol agreements. The survey produces statistics on shipments of fertilizer in Canada by manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retail distributors. This survey is a continuation of a survey that was conducted by the Canadian Fertilizer Institute, which covers all major Canadian manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retail distributors. Aggregate data will be used by analysts to determine the province of destination for fertilizer products manufactured in Canada or imported into Canada, by product type and by nutrient content. Tables will also be provided for fertilizer production at the Canada level and for market inventories for East and West.\", 'Farming Facts\\nFarming Facts is published by the Agriculture Division of Statistics Canada to illustrate the variety of information produced by the organization for the agricultural community.

Technological advances include computer-based information and control systems, as well as sophisticated processing and packaging methods that enhance product quality, improve food safety and reduce costs. Continuous quality improvement and benchmarking are examples of related business practices. This study examines the use of advanced technologies in the food-processing industry. It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology. Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology. Firms that differ in size and nationality choose to pursue different technological strategies. This study focuses on how these differences are reflected in the different use of technology for large and small establishments, for foreign and domestic plants and for plants in different industries.', 'Results from the Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals Survey - 2005\\nThis working paper profiles Canadian firms involved in the production and distribution of functional foods and/or nutraceuticals (FFN).

An integrated life course and social determinants model of Aboriginal health framework is used to guide the analysis.', \"The soybean, agriculture's jack-of-all-trades, is gaining ground across Canada\\nUntil the mid-1970s, soybeans were restricted by climate primarily to southern Ontario. Intensive breeding programs have since opened up more widespread growing possibilities for this incredibly versatile crop in Canada: The 1.2 million hectares of soybeans reported on the Census of Agriculture in 2006 marked a near eightfold increase in area since 1976, the year the ground-breaking varieties that perform well in Canada's shorter growing season were introduced.\", 'Bison on the comeback trail\\nThe once scarce bison population continues to grow on Canadian farms. According to the 2006 Census of Agriculture, the bison herd, at 195,728 head, has increased 34.9% since 2001.', 'Organic: from niche to mainstream\\nWith growing consumer demand and increasing visibility, many organic food products in Canada are being showcased in grocery stores, natural food stores, farmers markets and in community-supported agriculture projects. For consumers the challenge is to know what organic really means. Is it the same as certified organic? How large is the market for organic food in Canada and what are farmers doing to address the demand? This article provides insight on this rapidly evolving organic food sector of agriculture in Canada.', \"That beet is sweet!\\nSugar beets, significantly established in Canada in the first half of the 20th century, continue to sweeten things for farmers in Ontario and Alberta, according to Census of Agriculture data. Although Canada's sugar beet area in 2006, at 19,488 hectares, is only half the 1951 peak, the crop continues to thrive in Alberta, and has made a comeback in Ontario, a province where it had not been significant for decades.\", 'Fork in the road: Canadian agriculture and food on the move\\nFood is as much a necessity as the air we breathe and the water we drink. But do we know where our food comes from, and what it takes to get it into our kitchens? The question of where our food is grown or processed is coming under increased scrutiny, not just in Canada but in other countries, including our trading partners. Concerns underlying this increased focus include discussions of energy consumption required for food transport, environmental concerns, product safety, food security and food costs. The article, Fork in the Road, takes a look at the trade in food and shows how Canadians can find out what foods are being produced in their local area.', \"Turkey industry adapting to new Canadian demographics\\nThink fast, what's the first food you think of when someone says Thanksgiving dinner'? Most people would be quick to reply turkey of course. Increasingly, though, turkeys are no longer solely associated with Thanksgiving or Christmas and can be found year-round in our grocery stores and on our tables. In 2006, the Census of Agriculture identified 3,174 Canadian farms reported 7.7 million turkeys on their operations.\", 'Sour cherries in Canada\\nWhat could be better than a home-made cherry pie coming fresh out of the oven, with the wonderful smell of rich cherries and bright red juice. Historically there have been two main types of cherries; sweet cherries which we eat fresh from the tree and farmers markets in the summer, and sour cherries, which we find in a variety of processed forms. Sour cherries are aptly named for their sour flavour compared to the regular sweet cherries. Canadian plant breeders have been working to produce a third type of cherry, one that combines the best traits of both sweet and sour cherries.', 'Canola: a Canadian success story\\nWith its vibrant yellow flowers, a canola field is a beautiful sight. And its colour is a clue to its family history mustard. Canola refers to a particular group of rapeseed varieties, a species of the much larger mustard family that includes, besides mustard, turnips, cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli. While these plants have been bred for their roots (turnips), leaves (cabbage) or immature flower heads (cauliflower and broccoli), the rapeseed branch of the family was bred to maximize production of the high-oil seeds that are used to produce vegetable oil.', \"Corn: Canada's third most valuable crop\\nFarmers and corn breeders have developed multiple varieties suited to particular uses and adapted to distinct environments. In Canada, three broad types of corn dominate farmers' fields: corn for grain, corn for silage, and sweet corn.\", 'The changing face of the Canadian fruit and vegetable sector: 1941 to 2011\\nHorticulture is a type of agriculture that encompasses a wide range of crop production. Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products. Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields.', \"Feeding the soil puts food on your plate\\nAs crops grow, they deplete the soil's fertility by absorbing nutrients from the land. These nutrients, need to be replenished in order to ensure that there is something in the soil for the next year's crops. Canadian agriculture relies heavily on commercial fertilizers as well as manure to replenish soil's nutrients. This article examines how farmers provide their crops with the nutrients they need to grow and how these farming practices have changed over time.\", 'The Changing Face of the Canadian Hog Industry\\nThe Canadian hog industry has changed greatly over the years. Data collected by the Census of Agriculture show that the industry has undergone a radical transformation. It has evolved from being an industry with a very large number of mixed farms, each possessing only a few pigs, to one with fewer large and highly specialized farms. It now plays a major role in exports and is constantly improving in terms of technology.', 'Pulses in Canada\\nA pulse is an edible seed harvested from the pod of a variety of annual leguminous plants.

The survey's main objective was to estimate the distributions of Canadians' usual dietary intake at the provincial level for 15 age-sex groups. Such distributions are generally estimated with the SIDE application, but with the choices that were made concerning sample design and method of estimating sampling variability, obtaining those estimates is not a simple matter. This article describes the methodological challenges in estimating usual intake distributions from the survey data using SIDE.\", 'Impact of telephone versus face to face repeat 24-hour recall interviews on food and nutrition surveys\\nMany population surveys collecting food consumption data use 24 hour recall methodology to capture detailed one day intakes. In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews.', 'Impact of number of repeat 24 hour recall interviews on estimation of usual intakes from food and nutrition surveys\\nNational Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders .', 'Regression weighting in the presence of nonresponse with application to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey\\nA regression weight generation procedure is applied to the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Regression estimation was used because of the large nonresponse in the survey. The regression weights are generalized least squares weights modified so that all weights are positive and so that large weights are smaller than the least squares weights. It is demonstrated that the regression estimator has the potential for large reductions in mean square error relative to the simple direct estimator in the presence of nonresponse.', 'Balancing sample design goals for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is one of a series of health-related programs sponsored by the United States National Center for Health Statistics. A unique feature of NHANES is the administration of a complete medical examination for each respondent in the sample. To standardize administration, these examinations are carried out in mobile examination centers. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors. The sample design for NHANES must create a balance between the requirements for efficient annual and multiyear samples and the flexibility that allows changes in key design parameters to make the survey more responsive to the needs of the research and health policy communities. This paper discusses the challenges involved in designing and implementing a sample selection process that satisfies the goals of NHANES.', \"Measuring Industry Concentration in Canada's Food Processing Sectors\\nThe objective of this study is to provide up-to-date measures of the concentration of the manufacturing industries in the Canadian food-processing sector.\", 'Comparative Study of Analytical Consumer Price Indexes for Different Subgroups of the Reference Population\\nThe reference population for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been represented, since the 1992 updating of the basket of goods and services, by families and unattached individuals living in private urban or rural households. The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers. Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada. In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level. The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population.', 'Using Median Expenditures: Impact on Household Spending Data\\nThis paper provides some guidance to users on the use of medians and also gives some examples of situations when it can be a more appropriate measure than the average.', \"2001 Food Expenditure Survey, Data Quality Indicators\\nThe Food Expenditure Survey (FES) is a periodic survey collecting data from households on food spending habits.

       " <span class=\"description\">Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, it is possible to estimate the distributions of usual nutrient intake. It is more difficult to estimate the usual consumption of specific food items. Consumption has to be estimated by combining the food item's consumption frequency with the distribution of consumers' usual intake of the food item. It may be difficult to estimate that distribution for less common food items, and it is virtually impossible to obtain reliable estimates of the food item's consumption frequency with only two days of data per respondent. Using an outside source or a parametric assumption may help to overcome this problem. One solution is to use an indirect approach to estimate a food item's impact on the distribution of a nutrient's usual intake by eliminating that food item or partly or completely replacing it with another food item. </span></th>\n",

While managers in both countries generally place quite similar emphases on items in the list of benefits received and problems that have impeded adoption, there are significant differences that arise because of the smaller size of the Canadian market. </span></th>\n",

The study first focuses on the importance of research and development activity and advanced business practices used by production and engineering departments. Second, it examines the extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&amp;D.; Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag. </span></th>\n",

The numbers of technologies used by a plant is found to be highly correlated with expected gains in firm performance. The benefits of enhanced food safety and quality, as well as productivity improvements, are closely associated with technology use. Impediments that negatively affect technology use include software costs, problems with external financing, lack of cash flow for financing, and internal management problems. Even after accounting for the different benefits and costs associated with technology adoption, the numbers of advanced technologies that are adopted are found to be greater in larger plants, in foreign-controlled plants, in plants that engage in both primary and secondary processing, and in the dairy, fruit and vegetable and \"other\" food product industries. </span></th>\n",

This article marks the completion of the work involved in updating the TSA for the 1992 reference year and the revisions made to the 1988 year. An analysis of the results as well as a discussion of the structural changes between the two reference years is presented in this paper. In addition, the underlying reasons for the revisions to the previously published 1988 estimates are discussed.

Still, supermarkets across the country are setting aside ever-larger portions of their produce sections for organic produce, and natural food stores are expanding rapidly.

       " <span class=\"description\">Total income of farm families is derived from 1999 personal income tax returns of family members. The estimates refer to the income of families involved in a single unincorporated farm, showing a gross operating revenue of $10,000 and over. Families are defined as husband and wife, legal or common-law, with or without children at home; or lone parent, of any marital status, with at least one child living at home. There is no restriction on the age of the children. Children must report a marital status other than \"married\" or \"living common-law\" and have no child living in the household. In 1999, these families operated 150,500 farms, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of unincorporated farms (single operations) reporting a gross revenue of $10,000 and over. Net farm operating income refers to the profit (or loss) from performance of farm operations based on total operating revenues, including all program payments, less total operating expenses, before deducting depreciation. In 1998, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) developed a farm typology, which categorizes farms into more homogeneous groups than classification based on size, contribution to total agricultural production, or national net farm operating income. Factors such as age, income, business intentions and revenue class have been used to categorize farm operators and farm families into distinct groups. A description of the farm types is presented at the end of this article. </span></th>\n",

Proposals for new hog operations, among others, have encountered vocal opposition from neighbours and residents in the community. Promoters defended the economic value of their project claiming that good farming practices and improved technology minimizes the potential risk of nuisance and pollution. However, opponents raised concerns about the reduction of their quality of life in association with large livestock operations, especially hog farms. They fear being driven out of their homes by strong odours or worry about accidental contamination of ground water in surrounding areas, as in Walkerton, Ontario.

       " <span class=\"description\">Statistics Canada administers six surveys per year to collect information on intended, seeded and harvested acreages, yields, production and stocks of principal field crops, and publishes these survey estimates in the Field Crop Reporting Series (FCRS). This paper analyses short-term movements in weekly crop prices from the week before the releases of FCRS to the week after the releases. Field crops included in this study are oats, canola, corn, flax, barley and wheat, while specialty crops studied are sunflower seed, canary seed, field peas, lentils, mustard seed, chick peas and green peas. The data for field crops cover a period from 1990 to 2009 and that for specialty crops cover varying periods from 1992 to 2009 based on their availability. The results reveal that the price changes before and after the official releases of FCRS tend to even out over time. The results also suggest that prices after the releases are as likely to increase as they are to decrease. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the publication of statistics in the FCRS has no systematic effect on crop prices. The results are consistent with the findings of the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. </span></th>\n",

       " <span class=\"description\">While the number of census-farms and farm operators is shrinking, the number of jobs in the agriculture and agri-food industry is growing. During the 15-year period from 1981 to 1996, the industry employed 15% of Canada's workforce. Employment in the agri-food sector has grown faster than the overall Canadian economy and this has offset the decline in employment on farms. In 1981, more people worked on farms than worked in restaurants, bars and taverns. By 1996, this trend had reversed and employment in the food and beverage services sector far outstripped the number of workers on farms. Food processing is often promoted as part of agricultural policy (to provide a local market for Canadian farmers) and as part of rural development policy (to create jobs in rural areas). However, in 1996, fewer people were working in Canada's food processing sector than in 1981. More food was processed (there was growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of this sector), but fewer workers were involved. Rural regions adjacent to urban areas gained a greater share of food processing employment, making these regions relatively competitive in keeping food processing workforces. Employment in the agricultural and agri-food sectors is growing, but the nature of the work and where it is being done is changing. </span></th>\n",

Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize risk to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The 2001 Farm Environmental Management Survey (FEMS), conducted by Statistics Canada in March 2002, was carried out on behalf of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in order to measure current farm environmental initiatives and farming practices. The survey collected information from 16,000 farmers on the management of manure, grazing systems, crop nutrients, pesticides, soil and water, as well as whole farm environmental management. </span></th>\n",

Canadian farmers are actively involved in environmental initiatives and are adopting farming practices that minimize pollution risks to air, water and soil, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The FEMS results presented here provide an overview of grazing practices. However, management practices that could be protective or detrimental to the environment and that relate to grazing systems are much broader than those included in this bulletin. Further, regional differences in climate and soil quality mean that there is no \"optimal\" or \"correct\" grazing practice that is applicable throughout the whole country or even within an individual province. In this paper, discussion focuses on farms with grazing cattle that derive 51% or more of their gross farm receipts from either beef or dairy production. Results show that grazing management practice varies by region of Canada and by farm size. </span></th>\n",

Data are presented for 21 major groups and selected individual industries at the 3- to 6-digit level of detail, as defined by the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), as well as aggregates for durable, non-durable and total manufacturing. Major group industry data are shown with and without adjustment for seasonal variation. Unadjusted shipment totals by province and by major groups within provinces are also shown. These data are used to monitor the business cycle in the manufacturing sector of the economy, to evaluate and develop financial and industrial policy, and to provide market data at the detailed industry level. Related information on manufacturers' opinions on the current state of inventories and orders and about employment and production prospects over the next three months are available from the Business Conditions Survey (BCS). The survey is carried out at the beginning of January, April, July and October. Responses are available approximately five days after the reference month in Statistics Canada's <em>The Daily</em>. The BCS balance of opinion data often serves as a good guide to the direction of change, at least a month in advance of the corresponding quantitative data. </span></th>\n",

It explores the role that certain factors play in conditioning the likelihood of survival - factors related to industry structure, firm demographics and macroeconomic cycles. It asks whether the determinants of failure are different for new start-ups than for firms that have reached adolescence, and if the magnitude of these differences is economically significant. It examines whether, after controlling for certain influences, failure rates differ across industries and provinces. Two themes figure prominently in this analysis. The first is the impact that certain industry characteristics - such as average firm size and concentration - have on the entry/exit process, either through their influence on failure costs or on the intensity of competition. The second centres on how the dimensions of failure evolve over time as new firms gain market experience. </span></th>\n",

In 1996, personal expenditures amounted to 58.3% of Canada's nominal gross domestic product (GDP), up from 56.6% in 1986. Aggregate consumer spending patterns are affected by several factors. Consumer tastes can shift over time, as new commodities are introduced and others become outdated.

Like the original in 1996, this report provides a comprehensive and detailed statistical overview of the health status of Canadians and the major determinants of that status. The original report was created for the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, which has also commissioned this update. The broad purpose of the report is to help policy-makers and program planners identify priority issues and measure progress in the domain of population health. The <em>Statistical report</em> is meant to be a tool for learning as well as planning. The data identify populations at risk; suggest associations between health determinants, health status, and population characteristics; raise questions about the reasons for the widespread differences among the provinces and territories; and illustrate areas where Canada's health information system is robust, and others where it is relatively weak. These and other themes are touched on in the 11 section introductions of the Statistical Report and developed more fully in the companion publication, <em>Toward a healthy future: second report on the health of Canadians</em>.

Technological advances include computer-based information and control systems, as well as sophisticated processing and packaging methods that enhance product quality, improve food safety and reduce costs. Continuous quality improvement and benchmarking are examples of related business practices. This study examines the use of advanced technologies in the food-processing industry. It focuses not just on the incidence and intensity of use of these new technologies but also on the way technology relates to overall firm strategy. It also examines how technology use is affected by selected industry structural characteristics and how the adoption of technologies affects the performance of firms. It considers as well how the environment influences technological change. The nature and structure of the industry are shown to condition the competitive environment, the business strategies that are pursued, product characteristics and the role of technology. Firms make strategic choices in light of technological opportunities and the risks and opportunities provided by their competitive environments. They implement strategies through appropriate business practices and activities, including the development of core competencies in the areas of marketing, production and human resources, as well as technology. Firms that differ in size and nationality choose to pursue different technological strategies. This study focuses on how these differences are reflected in the different use of technology for large and small establishments, for foreign and domestic plants and for plants in different industries. </span></th>\n",

Fruit, vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant culture all fall under the umbrella of horticulture. There are two broad categories of crops within horticulture: edible and non-edible crops. Edible horticulture crops, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, are products grown for human food that are either consumed fresh or processed into value-added products, such as frozen foods, preserves and wine. Although they are not biologically classified as plants, mushrooms are considered to be an edible product of horticulture. Medicinal plants which are grown for teas and supplements such as ginseng are also considered to be edible horticultural products. Non-edible horticulture crops are not used as food but are rather produced for other purposes. For instance, cut flowers, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, and perennials are grown as ornamental plants to enhance the appearance of homes, offices, gardens and public spaces. Sod farming is another type of non-edible horticulture which produces established turf for lawns, parks and sports fields. </span></th>\n",

In order to estimate longer term intakes of foods and nutrients from these data, methods have been developed that required a repeat recall to be collected from at least a subset of responders in order to estimate day to day variability. During the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 Nutrition Focus Survey, most first interviews were collected in person and most repeat interviews were conducted by telephone. This paper looks at the impact of the mode of interview on the reported foods and nutrients on both the first day and the repeat day and on the estimation of intra individual variability between the first and the second interviews. </span></th>\n",

       " <span class=\"description\">National Food and Nutrition Surveys provide critical information to support the understanding the complex relationship between health and diet in the population. Many of these surveys use 24 hour recall methodology which collects at a detailed level all food and beverages consumed over a day. Often it is the longer term intake of foods and nutrients that is of interest and a number of techniques are available that allow estimation of population usual intakes. These techniques require that at least one repeat 24 hour recall be collected from at least a subset of the population in order to estimate the intra individual variability of intakes. Deciding on the number of individuals required to provide a repeat is an important step in the survey design that must recognize that too few repeat individuals compromises the ability to estimate usual intakes, but large numbers of repeats are costly and pose added burden to the respondents. This paper looks at the statistical issues related to the number of repeat individuals, assessing the impact of the number of repeaters on the stability and uncertainty in the estimate of intra individual variability and provides guidance on required number of repeat responders . </span></th>\n",

       " <span class=\"description\">The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is one of a series of health-related programs sponsored by the United States National Center for Health Statistics. A unique feature of NHANES is the administration of a complete medical examination for each respondent in the sample. To standardize administration, these examinations are carried out in mobile examination centers. The examination includes physical measurements, tests such as eye and dental examinations, and the collection of blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing. NHANES is an ongoing annual health survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. The major analytic goals of NHANES include estimating the number and percentage of persons in the U.S. population and in designated subgroups with selected diseases and risk factors. The sample design for NHANES must create a balance between the requirements for efficient annual and multiyear samples and the flexibility that allows changes in key design parameters to make the survey more responsive to the needs of the research and health policy communities. This paper discusses the challenges involved in designing and implementing a sample selection process that satisfies the goals of NHANES. </span></th>\n",

       " <span class=\"description\">The reference population for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been represented, since the 1992 updating of the basket of goods and services, by families and unattached individuals living in private urban or rural households. The official CPI is a measure of the average percentage change over time in the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by Canadian consumers. Because of the broadly defined target population of the CPI, the measure has been criticised for failing to reflect the inflationary experiences of certain socio-economic groups. This study examines this question for three sub-groups of the reference population of the CPI. It is an extension of earlier studies on the subject done at Statistics Canada. In this document, analytical consumer price indexes sub-group indexes are compared to the analytical index for the whole population calculated at the national geographic level. The findings tend to point to those of earlier Statistics Canada studies on sub-groups in the CPI reference population. Those studies have consistently concluded that a consumer price index established for a given sub-group does not differ substantially from the index for the whole reference population. </span></th>\n",
